## Producer-Consumer Problem Simulation
- This project simulates a producer-consumer problem with multiple producers and consumers synchronized via a shared buffer
- Each producer generates sales records with random data, and each consumer computes local statistics from these records.

## Problem Description
- In this scenario, there are p producers and c consumers, each operating as a single thread. 
- They share a buffer of size b to exchange data. 
- Each buffer item represents a sales record containing sales date, store ID, register number, and sale amount. 
- The producers generate sales records randomly and store them in the shared buffer. 
- The consumers read the records from the buffer, compute local statistics, and contribute to global statistics.

## Program Structure
- Producer: Generates sales records with random data and places them in the shared buffer.
- Consumer: Reads sales records from the shared buffer, computes local statistics, and contributes to global statistics.
- Shared Buffer: Synchronized space where producers place sales records and consumers retrieve them.
- Global Statistics: Maintains overall sales statistics including store-wide total sales, month-wise total sales, aggregate sales, and total simulation time.

## Data Generation
- Each producer generates sales records randomly with the following characteristics:
    - Sales Date (DD/MM/YY) within the range 1-30 for day, 01-12 for month, and fixed year 23.
    - Store IDs range from 1 to p.
    - Register numbers range from 1 to 6 for any store.
    - Sale amount ranges between 0.50 and 999.99.
- Each producer randomly sleeps for 5-40 milliseconds after generating a record.

## Shared Variables and Semaphores
- Shared Variables:
    - Shared buffer: A buffer of size b for producers and consumers to exchange sales records.
    - Total records count: Maintains the total number of items generated by all producers.

## Semaphores:
- Mutex: Ensures mutual exclusion while accessing shared variables to prevent race conditions.
- Full: Indicates the number of available spaces in the buffer for producers to produce items.
- Empty: Indicates the number of items in the buffer for consumers to consume.

## Running the Program
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
- The program will execute simulations for different configurations of producers and consumers.
- The output will display local statistics for each consumer, as well as overall global statistics.

## Sample Run
```
./sales_system
Enter the number of producers: 2
Enter the number of consumers: 10
```
## Sample Output
```
