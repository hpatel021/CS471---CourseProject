# Virtual Memory Management Simulation Report

## Introduction

Virtual memory management plays a crucial role in modern computer systems, allowing efficient utilization of memory resources by providing the illusion of a larger address space than physically available memory. Page replacement algorithms are integral to this process, determining which pages to evict from memory when new pages need to be brought in. In this report, we present the results of simulations conducted to evaluate the performance of different page replacement algorithms under varying workload and system configurations.

## Methodology

### Page Replacement Algorithms

Four page replacement algorithms were evaluated in our simulations:

- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: Evicts the oldest page in memory.
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Evicts the least recently accessed page.
- **Most Recently Used (MRU)**: Evicts the most recently accessed page.
- **Optimal**: Evicts the page that will not be accessed for the longest duration in the future.

### Simulation Setup

The simulations were conducted using a range of parameters, including different page sizes and numbers of frames allocated to the process. Each combination of parameters was tested with all four page replacement algorithms to assess their performance.

## Results

### Summary of Runs

The simulations yielded the following observations:

- **FIFO Algorithm**: Consistently maintained low to moderate page fault rates, typically ranging from 0.25% to 1.50%.

- **LRU Algorithm**: Exhibited stable performance similar to FIFO, with page fault percentages within the same range.

- **MRU Algorithm**: Showed comparable performance to FIFO and LRU, with consistent page fault percentages across various scenarios.

- **Optimal Algorithm**: Demonstrated slightly superior performance, particularly in scenarios with larger memory sizes and frame allocations. Page fault percentages ranged from 0.20% to 1.20%, showcasing its efficiency in predictive memory management.

### Conclusions

1. **Algorithmic Robustness**: All tested page replacement algorithms displayed commendable performance, effectively managing memory resources under diverse workload conditions.

2. **Strategic Considerations**: While FIFO, LRU, and MRU provided reliable memory management, the Optimal algorithm exhibited potential for enhanced efficiency, especially in scenarios requiring proactive page replacement strategies.

3. **Future Exploration**: Further investigation into hybrid approaches or algorithmic refinements may unlock additional opportunities for optimizing virtual memory management systems, aligning them more closely with specific performance objectives and operational requirements.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our simulations offer valuable insights into the behavior and performance of different page replacement algorithms in virtual memory management systems. These findings provide a foundation for informed decision-making in selecting and refining memory management strategies to optimize system performance and resource utilization.
