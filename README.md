# CS471 Course Project
- This repository contains two sub-projects: PRODCONS and VMEMMAN. 
- Each sub-project includes source code, executable code, sample input data files, sample output files, a `README.md` file with instructions, and a report summarizing findings from experiments.

## PRODCONS
- The PRODCONS sub-project simulates a producer-consumer problem with multiple producers and consumers. 
- It includes the following components:
    - README: Instructions on running the program, including actual commands.
    - Source Code: Well-documented code for the producer-consumer simulation.
    - Executable Code: Compiled executable for running the simulation.
    - Sample Input Data Files: Files containing sample input data for the simulation.
    - Sample Output Files: Files containing sample output from the simulation.
    - Report: Summary of findings from experiments conducted with the simulation.

## Instructions
- To run the PRODCONS simulation:

1. Navigate to the PRODCONS directory.
2. Compile the source code if necessary.
3. Run the executable code with appropriate parameters.
4. Review the output files for simulation results.
5. Refer to the report for a summary of findings and analysis.

## VMEMMAN
- The VMEMMAN sub-project deals with virtual memory management algorithms. 
- It includes the following components:
    - README: Instructions on running the program, including actual commands.
    - Source Code: Well-documented code for virtual memory management.
    - Executable Code: Compiled executable for running the virtual memory management simulation.
    - Sample Input Data Files: Files containing sample input data for the simulation.
    - Sample Output Files: Files containing sample output from the simulation.
    - Report: Summary of findings from experiments conducted with the virtual memory management simulation.

## Instructions
- To run the VMEMMAN simulation:

1. Navigate to the VMEMMAN directory.
2. Compile the source code if necessary.
3. Run the executable code with appropriate parameters.
4. Review the output files for simulation results.
5. Refer to the report for a summary of findings and analysis.
